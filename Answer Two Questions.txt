*How can js spport multiple inheritance?
By mixins 
mixins are a way to combine multiple objects or behaviors into a single object. You can create separate objects that encapsulate specific sets of properties and methods, and then mix them together to create a new object with combined functionality.
---------------------------------------------------
*static method can be overloaded but not override (explain)
because override changes implementation in runtime not compile time and static method is solved in compile time
